Data Description:
A set of four Li-ion batteries (# 49 - 52) were run through 3 different operational profiles (charge, discharge and impedance) at an ambient temperature of 4 deg C. Charging was carried out in a constant current (CC) mode at 1.5A until the battery voltage reached 4.2V and then continued in a constant voltage (CV) mode until the charge current dropped to 20mA. Fixed load current level of 2A was used and the discharge runs were stopped at 2V, 2.2V, 2.5V and 2.7V for batteries 49, 50, 51 and 52 respectively. Impedance measurement was carried out through an electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) frequency sweep from 0.1Hz to 5kHz. The experiments were carried out until the experiment control software crashed.  Note that there are several discharge runs where the capacity as well as voltage levels were very low. Reasons for this have not been fully analyzed.
