Data Description:
A set of three Li-ion batteries (# 33, 34 and 36) were run through 3 different operational profiles (charge, discharge and impedance) at room temperature (24 deg C). Charging was carried out in a constant current (CC) mode at 1.5A until the battery voltage reached 4.2V and then continued in a constant voltage (CV) mode until the charge current dropped to 20mA. Discharge was carried out at 4A until the battery voltage fell to 2.0V and 2.2V for batteries 33 and 34 respectively. For battery 36 discharge was done at 2A until voltage fell to 2.7V. Impedance measurement was carried out through an electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) frequency sweep from 0.1Hz to 5kHz. The experiments were carried out until the capacity had reduced to 1.6Ahr (20% fade).
