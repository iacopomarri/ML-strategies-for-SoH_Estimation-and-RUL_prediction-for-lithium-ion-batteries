Data Description:
A set of three Li-ion batteries (# 38, 39 and 40) were run through 3 different operational profiles (charge, discharge and impedance) at multiple ambient temperatures (24 & 44 deg C). Charging was carried out in a constant current (CC) mode at 1.5A until the battery voltage reached 4.2V and then continued in a constant voltage (CV) mode until the charge current dropped to 20mA. Multiple load current levels (1, 2, and 4 A) were used and the discharge runs were stopped at 2.2V, 2.5V and 2.7V for batteries 38, 39 and 40 respectively. Impedance measurement was carried out through an electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) frequency sweep from 0.1Hz to 5kHz. The experiments were carried out until the capacity had reduced to 1.6Ahr (20% fade).
